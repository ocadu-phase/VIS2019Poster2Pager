This research stems from previous work in developing direct-write holography prints of a voxelized brain model, to develop awareness in brain research through the exhibition of such works.  The research also adds to the work of ColorMoves, where colormap applications in scientific visualization were explored with use cases in climate science, neutron spectroscopy, and asteroid ocean impacts.  In the writeup that follows, we further this exploration with medical imaging, with a focus on applying divergent and structured colormaps to volume data.
