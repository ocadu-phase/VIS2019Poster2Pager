Again we need to see the results to fully talk about this but i was thinking we need to answer the following questions

\begin{itemize}
    \item what are the advantages of our method opposed to others
    \item how did colour play a factor in creating segmentation
    \item how did volumetric rendering play a factor in solving occlusion
    \item in terms of computation how are we better than the current approach 
    \item what are our future work
\end{itemize}
