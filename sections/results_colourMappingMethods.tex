\subsection{Colour Mapping Methods}
In the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram, the Y component represents the photopic luminance.  As we know luminance is key to the ability to pinoint detail in segmentation, and the single most important factor in selecting colormaps in this process.  Previous research suggests that luminance is much stronger with colormaps that have two or more interpolation points, and as such has directed our preference towards divergent colormaps and structure colormaps.\\

The search for increased luminance has been the criteria that has steered our research results towards combining forces of an HDR linear workflow, and control of volumetric lighting.  These characteristics of our proposed pipeline are strongly complemented by adding colormaps to the process at either the input stage of MRI data processing or during the volumetric rendering process.  Both methods reveal more insights from the data of the MRI, and create options bringing color snd luminance to the workflows.
