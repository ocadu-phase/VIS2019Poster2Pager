In this work we present a visualization pipeline to express a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volume data, as a full coloured hologram.  We believe our pipeline can highlight salient structure information which reside within the data without extensive processing of the raw MRI, by utilizing its spatial and temporal characteristics.  Our unique approach on MRI visualizing highlights the importance of using the right colourmap and the untapped use of holograms in the medical field to give depth information.  We employ artist-driven colour techniques which make use of luminance and saturation rather than the current standard of contrast of hues. Our poster will provide a brief overview of the current spatial displays in medical imaging application and describe both the current process of processing an MRI dataset, through model construction, computer graphic rendering, and hologram encoding to our proposed pipeline of; MRI dataset, colour mapping, and hologram encoding.  We show the results of our pipeline, highlight various structures within the data without the use of sophisticated segmentation techniques.
