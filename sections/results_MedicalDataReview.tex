\subsection{Medical Data Review}
I can't really say anything about this because I do not have any results to speak of.  Meaning we do not have a hologram.  But I was thinking maybe we can create a side by side comparison of the volumetric rendered images with various colour mapping techniques as well as compare them to the geometry based one that was segmented.  Some current ones like gray scale, rainbow and jet, and then we can show our mapping techniques. Then we can talk about the following topics
\begin{itemize}
    \item highlight the advantages of our colour map opposed to others
    \item highlight the importance of geometry vs. volumetric rendering
    \item which one is more true to the medical data (we need Trevor to speak on this)
\end{itemize}
